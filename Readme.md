Run `setup_blender` once. This will download blender 2.79b, extract it, and the helper addon.

Then run `render` to render everything. That's all.

Don't run `blenderscript.py` directly, only run it trough blender, preferably in batch mode. It also works with the full blender UI on top but will freeze the entire UI during rendering.
